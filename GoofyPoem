Goofy Poem and Vogon hold and Spoilers

When in the course of human events,
it becomes necessary to stop and smell
powerful scents, your nose relents,
I wont kiss and tell.

Dank is damp? I'm never sure,
here differ Daniel Web. and Ol' Roget,
or was it Mr. Noah, my memory's so impure,
oh who will best describe our strong boquet?

The squalid hold held aweful sights
of garments, alien style,
and turgid bees all buzzed about 
the growing, fetid pile.

Suddenly our ears were struck
by gargles, sloshes, grunts
we're still to find, at root, behind
it all is Gag Halfrunt!
